# Deno X RPS
Measure request per sec for deno third party's http servers.

## Prepare
- [autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon)
```bash
$ npm i autocannon -g
```

- [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) ^v1.8.2

## Benchmarks

CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8279U CPU @ 2.40GHz

```bash
$ autocannon -c 100 -d 40 -p 10 localhost:8080
```

This is a synthetic, hello world benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework overhead. The overhead that each framework has on your application depends on your application, you should always benchmark if performance matters to you.
